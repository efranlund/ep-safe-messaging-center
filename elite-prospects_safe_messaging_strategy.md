1. Executive summary
Elite Prospects is moving from “data platform” to “community platform” with features like Messenger, video uploads and team communication. That shift creates a new risk surface, especially because:
We have a very high share of minor users (junior and youth players).


We also have a very high share of unrelated adults on the platform (scouts, coaches, agents, staff, media).
In this environment, unrestricted private messaging between adults and minors is no longer acceptable by the standards that now apply in:
The United States. SafeSport and the Minor Athlete Abuse Prevention Policies (MAAPP). 


Canada. The Canadian Safe Sport Program and the “Rule of Two”. 


The European Union. The Digital Services Act (DSA) guidelines for minors plus GDPR expectations around “safety by design” for children. 


In parallel, large social platforms (Meta/Instagram, TikTok, etc.) now block or heavily restrict adult initiated messaging to teens and use this as a core safety and compliance defense.

Proposed Solution:

Before parent verification is done

A minor can receive a message, but can't read it

A minor can't send any messages

A minor can receive and send messages in group chats without a parent involved

Messaging onboarding (First time visiting message center as a minor)

Show a link that the user can either click or share easily to its parent

If DoB is missing for the player, ask for that. (For now dont store it in EP Sports db)



The landing page (from link) 

Unique URL for this player

Same user can have 1 or more minors connected

Ask for Name, dob(?), email, connection to the minor(?)

In-chat-notifications

If you're an adult writing to a minor, a bar should always be visible telling you that your'e writing to a minor, but it's safe due to the adult verification.

If you're a minor writing to another minor, this notification should not be visible. (??)

E-mail communication to adult

Every day when 1 or more message has been sent in a conversation with the minor

A summary of what persons the minor have had conversation with. Link to the Safe Messaging Center for each conversation.

Immediately when a new conversation has been initialised. No matter who started the conversation

We need to log all emails being sent to the adult

Questions

Does the parent need to be able to be a part of the discussion or is read-only enough?

Read-only is enough!

Do we have to verify the identity for the parent?

No. Only verify the email address

What happens when a player turns 18?

Detach the parent from the player. The parent should not be able to see any of the conversations anymore.
